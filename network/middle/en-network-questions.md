###2) What is DHCP and what is it used for?
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is used to allocate IP addresses to a large number of computer systems on a network. This helps you manage a large number of IP addresses very easily.
###3) What is DNS?
DNS stands for Domain Naming Service and is used to resolve IP addresses to names and names to IP addresses. DNS is like a translator for computers: computers understand numbers, not alphabet. For example, if we type hotmail.com, the computer doesn't understand it, so it uses DNS, which converts (hotmail.com) to (numbers) and then executes the command.
###4) What are forward and reverse DNS lookups?
